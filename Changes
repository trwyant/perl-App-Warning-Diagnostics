    This eelease changes the way the canned warning table is generated.
    Instead of scavenging the current warnings.pm only, all warnings.pm
    files since 5.6.0 inclusive are checked, downloading the kits if
    needed. Kits and supporting data are cached to minimize work. The
    cache location is NOT built in, but specified by either an
    environment variable or an option to tools/extract-warnings. An
    author test has been added to detect new or removed warning
    categories.

0.000_019	2025-07-17	T. R. Wyant
    Update canned warnings table to 5.42.0.

    Correct completion logic test for old Perls.

0.000_018	2025-03-12	T. R. Wyant
    Add an 'all' option, for all diagnostics.

    Add a 'brief' option, for only the first line of each diagnostic.
    The severity and category (or categirues) are appended, in
    parentheses.

    Add xt/author/verbatim.t This is based on currently-unpublished
    Test-File-Verbatim.

    Allow option hash ref as first arg of warning_diagnostics().
    
    Depricate warning_diagnostics_exact(), since this is now possible via
    the options hash argument of warning_diagnostics().

0.000_017	2025-03-09	T. R. Wyant
    Update warnings list to version 1.70 (perl 5.40).

    Correct POD in script/perl-warning-diagnostics

0.000_016	2022-02-07	T. R. Wyant
    Update copyright to 2022.

    Rework tools/fatpack.

0.000_015	2021-12-29	T. R. Wyant
    Get Bash completion right. I hope.

0.000_014	2021-12-28	T. R. Wyant
    Add completion(), so it can be tested, and re-implement
    script/perl-warning-diagnostics in terms of this.

    Add test for warning_diagnostics_exact().

0.000_013	2021-12-27	T. R. Wyant
    Add exact reporting (i.e. no subcategories).  This is
    warning_diagnostics_exact() in the .pm, and --exact in the
    script.

    Update warnings table for Perl 5.35.7. No changes.

    Rename script to perl-warning-diagnostics

    Test for handling of empty =item.

    Recognize group categories with directly-assigned diagnostics.

    Remove block-commented code.

    Add (and support) tools/fatpack

0.000_012	2021-11-06	T. R. Wyant
    Add removed warnings to canned list.

    Back-port to Perl 5.6, since that is when the warnings module was
    introduced.

    Convert to Test::More.

0.000_011	2021-10-22	T. R. Wyant
    Perl 5.35.5 added warning experimental::for_list.

0.000_010	2021-10-18	T. R. Wyant
    Clean up script/warning-diagnostics completion code.

0.000_009	2021-10-17	T. R. Wyant
    Improve recognition of multi-category diagnostics.  It seems we can
    have '(S non_unicode portable)' as well as '(W taint deprecated)'.

    Work on documentation.

0.000_008	2021-10-16	T. R. Wyant
    Enhance parsing of perldiag.pod to pick up more diagnostics.

    Bring documentation into line with current code.

    Add description to README.
    Connect to GitHub.

    Use hard-coded list of built-in warning categories.  There just
    turned out to be too much ad-hocery involved in deriving it from the
    %warnings::Bits hash keys, due to the fact that warnings::register
    modifies this hash, and there is no way to guarantee access to a
    pristine copy of the hash. I considered parsing warnings.pm in
    App::Warning::Diagnostics when it was loaded, but that felt fragile.
    Better to do the ad-hocery once for all.

    Made warning_diagnostics() return the individual selected diagnostics in
    list context, basically to make counting them easier via the Saturn
    operator =()=.

0.000_006	2021-10-14	T. R. Wyant
    Move all completion code to script/warning-diagnostics

    Drop 'no*' in favor of 'no-*' in warning categories and option
    completions.

    Recognize difference between completion behavior of bash and zsh's bash
    emulator when the word contains a colon.

    Option completions now complete -* as --*.

0.000_005	2021-10-13	T. R. Wyant
    Completion now only offers thru next '::' rather than the full list.

0.000_004	2021-10-13	T. R. Wyant
    Do not split the line being completed on ':'.

0.000_003	2021-10-13	T. R. Wyant
    Make public interface exportable. Static method calls are still
    supported.

    Add bash_completion().

0.000_002	2021-10-11	T. R. Wyant
    Add dependencies of script/warning-diagnostics since we _are_ in
    fact App-Warning-Diagnostics, and since they are all core (as of
    5.34.0) anyway.

    Fix Perl::Critic problems in script/warning-diagnostics

    Add script/warning-diagnostics to metadata for installation.
