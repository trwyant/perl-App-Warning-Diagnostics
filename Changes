    Move all completion code to script/warning-diagnostics

    Drop 'no*' in favor of 'no-*' in warning categories and option
    completions.

    Recognize difference between completion behavior of bash and zsh's bash
    emulator when the word contains a colon.

    Option completions now complete -* as --*.

    Add dependencies of script/warning-diagnostics since we _are_ in

    Add script/warning-diagnostics to metadata for installation.
