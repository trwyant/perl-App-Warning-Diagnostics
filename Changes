    Use hard-coded list of built-in warning categories.  There just
    turned out to be too much ad-hocery involved in deriving it from the
    %warnings::Bits hash keys, due to the fact that warnings::register
    modifies this hash, and there is no way to guarantee access to a
    pristine copy of the hash. I considered parsing warnings.pm in
    App::Warning::Diagnostics when it was loaded, but that felt fragile.
    Better to do the ad-hocery once for all.

    Made warning_diagnostics() return the individual selected diagnostics in
    list context, basically to make counting them easier via the Saturn
    operator =()=.

    Move all completion code to script/warning-diagnostics

    Drop 'no*' in favor of 'no-*' in warning categories and option
    completions.

    Recognize difference between completion behavior of bash and zsh's bash
    emulator when the word contains a colon.

    Option completions now complete -* as --*.

    Completion now only offers thru next '::' rather than the full list.

    Do not split the line being completed on ':'.

    Make public interface exportable. Static method calls are still
    supported.

    Add bash_completion().

    Add dependencies of script/warning-diagnostics since we _are_ in
    fact App-Warning-Diagnostics, and since they are all core (as of
    5.34.0) anyway.

    Fix Perl::Critic problems in script/warning-diagnostics

    Add script/warning-diagnostics to metadata for installation.
